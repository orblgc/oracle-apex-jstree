# APEX jsTree Region Plugin for Oracle APEX

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orblgc/oracle-apex-jstree/refs/heads/main/jstreepreview.png)

APEX-jsTree plugin brings the power of jsTree into Oracle APEX with zero-JSON on the database side and full client-side flexibility. Simply point it at your tables via two SQL queries (initial load and optional lazy-load), provide a small JSON config for checkboxes, drag-&-drop rules, custom context menus, search mapping, and node links, and let the plugin handle rendering, events, and PL/SQL callbacks. Built-in support for create, rename, delete, move operations (with bind variables like :TREE$NODE_ID) makes it a drop-in, open-source solution for hierarchical data in APEX.
